### Retrospective

**Student 1**
Abass Bayo-Awoyemi Ruan
* This week's medium post: An ode to the age of information. Big rant about how awesome he thinks it is that humanity has been defined by its elaborate relationship to technology.
* Last week’s goal:To be more comfortable with git and learn to troubleshoot
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) He has gotten a lot more comfortable with git and this was further reinforced during todays lesson when he found out that he can actually ask for Help on git. 
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) Maybe if we had set up the workflow of the files beforehand that could have made things more seamless. The 12 days of christmas song was great because it showed that there were multiple ways of solving the problem.
* What is your goal for next week? More experimenting with new functions.
* What do you need help with? He feels pretty comfortable with what has been convered so far. Would like help understanding strong concatenations. 

**Student 2**
Dison
* This week's medium post: Animation Cancel
* Last week’s goal: Attain Basic Mastery of Git
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I learned how to do the commands today. 
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) Would have been better if we had todays presentation a bit earlier. He couldn't get his computer at home to upload some code to github but today during the presentation it worked. A lot of frustration involved but finally got it. 
* What is your goal for next week? Finish atleast 40 units of Programming By Doing
* What do you need help with? Github... hopefully it keeps working as it did today. Rosmary suggested going through the Github tutorial on Slack a few times. 

**Student 3**
Janneisy Vidals
* This week's medium post: Getting Starter/Advice for New Programmers/Learning Terms/Attending Events/Googling Terms
* Last week’s goal: Getting more comfortable with Git/Github
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) Feeling some mastery of the basics including making a repo, and git
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) Challenges have been finding and reference the folders she previously created. The scanner exercise was a struggle to do based off of memory.
* What is your goal for next week? To continue practicing until she gets comfortable.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)To be more detail oriented

**Student 4**
Rosmary Fermin
* This week's medium post: What I have learned until this point by doing just the Application Process and the first week of AccessCode
* Last week’s goal: To get more comfortable with Git/Github
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I feel more comfortable with commiting and pushing and the code I have pushed to github.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) One of the challenges she faced was remembering all of the commands to get from one place to another within the terminal. She worked on this by keeping terminals open and referencing them whenever she got stuck on something. 
* What is your goal for next week? To practice Java more by doing more exercises
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Learning more about Git/Github

**Student 5**
Madelyn Tavarez
* This week's medium post: Getting Started with AccessCode 
* Last week’s goal: To get more comfortable with Github
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) Learning the new code
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) If Github would sync with my Git
* What is your goal for next week? To actually master Git/Github without catching errors all of the time 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Making Github and git work seamlessly

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
You can change your interpretation of events and how you allow them to affect the way you feel. 
Treating eachother like children is important because it would lead to developing better relationships with others. 
Tailor your messages to others in order to affect them in a positive way. 

* How does this think piece relate to access code?
"Optimists as good things as being general,personal, permanent and negative things as being impersonal, specific and temporary."
It is important to approach coding this way in order to avoid being discouraged of getting too frustrated. 
"Optimism is what drives us forward to create and change"
Its great to form this positive mentality you will be more open to other options and exploring and being curious about other avenues and perspectives.
