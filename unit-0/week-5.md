Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

What are 2 things you took from this think piece : 
1. thought it was interesting that the kind of body language we portray has a huge affect on our mindsets.
2. talked about chemistry of our body. If we stand at the superman pose for 2 minutes, we increase testosterone in our bodies.

How does this think piece relate to access code?
her story correlates to access code. (fake it until you become it) Some of us might have self doubts (am I really fit to become a programmer?).
If we fake it until we become it then we can all be programmers! We are all meant to be here.
I believe confidence can be faked very well, then people will ask if you are confident and in return boost your actual confidence. 


Extra comments / Anything you want your program managers to know
We will miss Alex and Greg very dearly.
