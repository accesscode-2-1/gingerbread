### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
* 1. it is okay to fail, as long as you keep trying. don't lose your grit!
*  How does this think piece relate to access code?
*2. In access code there might be moments  where you will get frustrated, and nothing might seem to work. Don't give up, stay confident and motivated. keep pushing towards your goal. You will get there.
