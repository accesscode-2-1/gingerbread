### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
Poalas speech was very motivational. 
employers are looking past the degree and looking at skill sets in order to higher. Keven reinforced being in love with the field he is in ( you have to love it in order to strive for it). 
They both had a lot of interesting experience that we can learn from and follow from. 
* How does this think piece relate to access code?
paola and kevin came from exteremely different backgrounds and they are both successful and i think that is what this program trying to do is bring people from differennt backgrounds as long as there is a drive for being in the tech community. 

### TODOs
In order to improve git commands in terminal Dison will create a practice repo where we will post our repo's numerous times untill we get better at it.
We will create our own private Gingerbread slack groupchat
