### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion) 

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece : Madelyn
*1. Madelyn: This week's medium post: Very sobering, what he was saying about going through series of confusion and finding the solution; it is similar to what we're experiencing "light at the end of the tunnel"
Rosmary: appreciated the part about the circle of learning. 
Dison: title is misleading. 
*2. In access code there might be moments  where you will get frustrated, and nothing might seem to work. Don't give up, stay confident and motivated. keep pushing towards your goal. You will get there.
